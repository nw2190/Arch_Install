As well as making a lot more actually work, I'm trying to clean things
up, both in the w3 and url packages, so that it might eventually go
into Emacs.

Emacs 20.3 or XEmacs 20.4 is now required -- by the Gnus dependency,
if nothing else.  That rules out VMS support.  The aim is to be
able to compile individual files without docomp.el, but I may have
missed some (eval-when-compile (require 'cl)) for Emacs 20, for
instance.  I'm aiming to dump mule-sysdp.el and rely on mm-util & al.
I'm also aiming to dump w3-sysdp.  It's unclean, for instance, to
define `extent' functions in Emacs without a name prefix -- other
packages test for their existence and then lose.

I haven't been testing much on XEmacs, and may well have broken things
for it.  In fact, I've mostly been testing in development Emacs 21.

There's plenty that still doesn't work, and docs are likely wrong.

HTH.
