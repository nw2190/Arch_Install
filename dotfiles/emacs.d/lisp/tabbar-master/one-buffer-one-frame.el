;; DESCRIPTION:
;; 
;; Always open new frames for each new buffer and switch to their frame.
;; In this minor mode, buffers are usually displayed in their own frames.
;; All buffer switching functions available to users will raise the
;; frame that shows the buffer. Deletion of the frame (or window) usually
;; kills the associated buffer, unless the buffer is still shown in another
;; window or it is a special-purpose buffer such as `*Messages*'.
;;
;; To enable, add this to your init file:
;; (one-buffer-one-frame-mode t)



;; KNOWN ISSUES

;; save-window-excursion does not unwind newly created frames.
;; because we advise switch-to-buffer to open stuff in new frames,
;; we get undesirable behavior, for example in viper-mode, where
;; an extra frame is opened.

;; it might make sense to extend save-window-excursion...

;; doesn't play well with ediff-directories
;; conjecture: ediff divides the frame (into two windows), then calls switch-to-buffer
;; instead of using pop-to-buffer

(define-minor-mode one-buffer-one-frame-mode
  "Always open new frames for each new buffer and switch to their frame.
In this minor mode, buffers are usually displayed in their own frames.
All buffer switching functions available to users will raise the
frame that shows the buffer. Deletion of the frame (or window) usually
kills the associated buffer, unless the buffer is still shown in another
window or it is a special-purpose buffer such as `*Messages*'. 

This minor mode provides some additional key bindings:

C-x B         `switch-to-buffer-here'
C-x S-left    `previous-buffer-here'
C-x S-right   `next-buffer-here'
C-x C-B       `list-buffers-here'

Decisions about showing buffers in separate frames can be influenced
in a number of customization variables. Buffers are, by default,
shown in new frames, unless they are switched to with `switch-to-buffer'
and match an entry in `obof-same-frame-switching-regexps', or they are
popped up with `pop-to-buffer' and match an entry in `obof-same-frame-regexps'
\(typically Emacs always shows these in a new window). 
A matching entry in `obof-other-frame-regexps' will always force buffers to 
be shown in a new frame.

The mode sets `pop-up-frames', `pop-up-windows', 
`display-buffer-reuse-frames'.

This mode is part of Aquamacs Emacs, http://aquamacs.org."
